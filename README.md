## Debiased Machine Learning with High-Dimensional Discrete Covariates
This repository contains the code and simulations for my Bachelor’s thesis
at the Technical University of Munich.

The project studies the behavior of nuisance function estimators in
high-dimensional discrete settings and their implications for Debiased
Machine Learning (Chernozhukov et al., 2018).

Main components:
- Monte Carlo simulations
